## Instructions

1. **Run `uv run pytest --tb=short`** — run the full test suite
2. **If tests fail**, analyze the output:
   - Identify which tests fail and why
   - Check if it's an import error, assertion failure, or exception
   - Note the exact error messages
3. **If there are import errors or missing dependencies**, fix them:
   - Update `pyproject.toml` with missing dependencies
   - Run `uv sync` to install
   - Re-run tests to verify
   - Commit fixes: `fix(deps): add missing dependency`
4. **Check test coverage against PRD**:
   - Are all routes tested? (`GET /`, `GET /<host>/<path>`, `GET /images/...`)
   - Are error cases tested? (400, 404, 413, 502, 504)
   - Are edge cases tested? (large PDFs, non-PDF URLs, concurrent requests)
   - Is the cache tested? (hit, miss, TTL)
   - Is the downloader tested? (URL validation, timeout, size limit)
   - Is the converter tested? (basic conversion, image extraction, LaTeX)
