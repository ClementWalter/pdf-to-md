# FINAL REVIEW — pdf2md (Pass {props.pass})

## Implementation Summary

What was done: {props.whatWasDone}
Implementer believes complete: {props.believesComplete}

## Test Results

- Tests passed: {props.testsPassed}
- Tests passing: {props.testsPassCount}
- Tests failing: {props.testsFailCount}

## Review Results

- Review severity: {props.reviewSeverity} (approved: {props.reviewApproved})

## Your Task

You are the GATEKEEPER. Decide whether pdf2md is complete and ready to ship.

Read the actual source files to verify — do NOT just trust the summaries above.
Read `PRD.md` to verify against the full specification.

## Decision Criteria

Set `readyToMoveOn: true` ONLY if ALL of these are met:

1. **Tests pass**: `uv run pytest` succeeds with all tests passing
2. **PRD compliance**: All P0 requirements from PRD sections 3.1-3.4 are implemented
3. **Routes work**: All three routes (`GET /`, `GET /<host>/<path>`, `GET /images/...`) are implemented
4. **Error handling**: All error responses per PRD section 6 are implemented
5. **Code quality**: Review severity is "none" or "minor" only
6. **Quality score >= 7**: Overall implementation quality
7. **Project structure**: pyproject.toml, Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml all present

Set `readyToMoveOn: false` if ANY of these:
- Tests failing
- Review has "critical" or "major" issues
- Core P0 requirements are missing
- Routes are not implemented
- No tests exist

## Reasoning

Your `reasoning` field is CRITICAL — it feeds back into the next pass's Implement step.
Be specific about:
- What's still missing
- What needs to change
- Which PRD requirements are not met
- Which tests are missing
- What the implementer should focus on next

## REQUIRED OUTPUT

You MUST end your response with a JSON object matching this schema:

{props.schema}
